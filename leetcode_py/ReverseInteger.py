"""
Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment that could 
only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. 
For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when 
the reversed integer overflows.


Example 1:

Input: x = 123
Output: 321
Example 2:

Input: x = -123
Output: -321

# Create solution instance
l = Solution()

a = 123

# Tests (Lists are mutuable so technically changes the original list)
l.reverse(a)
l.reverse(b)
